These issues affect the usability of the code and need to be addressed for the code to function as intended. There are no critical severity issues that would make the conversation not useful for the human user.\n",

As we used `np.linspace(0, 1, 21)` to generate the noise levels, we might not get precise values for 0.3 0.6 0.9 even though we've separated [0, 1] into 21 points due to how float numbers are stored in the computer. So to avoid a situation, where a very small difference prevents numbers from being seen as equal, I've added a threshold to ignore these small differences.\"}]"
